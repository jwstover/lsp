CMake Warning (dev) at teem/CMake/TestQnanhibit.cmake:33 (IF):
  Policy CMP0054 is not set: Only interpret if() arguments as variables or
  keywords when unquoted.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0054" for policy
  details.  Use the cmake_policy command to set the policy and suppress this
  warning.

  Quoted variables like "HAVE_QNANHIBIT_VALUE" will no longer be dereferenced
  when the policy is set to NEW.  Since the policy is not set the OLD
  behavior will be used.
